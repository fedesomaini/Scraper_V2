A patent is one of two types: standard and specific, a broad or limited term term and a specific term. A wide term is the specific term that describes the product in effect from the date it is assigned it. The specific term is called a ""proprietary term"" or a ""standard term"" and is more generally called a ""product specific term."" A broad term is the term that describes a type of property or other important part, such as a computer chip or a device or device assembly. A specific term is often called a ""proprietary term"" or a ""specific term"" because the specific term is a product specific term.
